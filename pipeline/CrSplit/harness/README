datarel  CrSplit/harness example
=============================================================================

In this example we run the CrSplit pipeline, launching it at the
level of pex_harness via the  launchPipeline.py script.

To run here at the pex_harness level, we perform by hand a couple of tasks
that ctrl_orca provides during "production" runs.

We link the input directory:

% ln -s /lsst/sims/ImSim_data input

and make the output directory :

% mkdir output

The pipeline can be then started via :

%  launchPipeline.py master.paf test_15040

The pipeline will block and wait for an incoming data event.
Provide this event with the trigger script :

% python triggerCrSplitEventTransmitter.py

This script will send events of topic "triggerCrSplitEvent" that contain keywords 
to identify the exposures to be processed, for example,

"inputPathName0" => "imsim_85751839_R23_S11_C04_E000" 
"inputPathName1" => "imsim_85751839_R23_S11_C04_E001"
