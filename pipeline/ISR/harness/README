datarel  ISR/harness example
=============================================================================

In this example we run the ISR pipeline, launching it at the 
level of pex_harness via the  launchPipeline.py script. 

To run here at the pex_harness level, we perform by hand a couple of tasks 
that ctrl_orca provides during "production" runs. 

We define the input directory in the 010-Input.paf policy:
	input: /lsst/sims/ImSim_data

and make the other output  directories : 

% cd ....datarel/pipeline/harness/
% mkdir output work scratch log

Since the camera geom is not ready for the butler...the camera geometry 
is placed on the clipboard via the triggerISREventTransmitter.


The pipeline can be then started via : 

% launchPipeline.py master.paf test_1 ISR -v

The pipeline will block and wait for an incoming data event.
Provide this event with the trigger script :

% python triggerISREventTransmitter.py 

This script will send events of topic "triggerISREvent" that contain a keyword
to identify the data set (uncalibratedImage) to be processed, for example,

"inputPathName" => "871034p_1_MI"

The Output Stage is configured to produce a single calibrated output file :

% ls -l output
........Fill in the sample ls........
