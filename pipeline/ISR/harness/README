datarel  ISR/harness example
=============================================================================

In this example we run the ISR pipeline, launching it at the 
level of pex_harness via the  launchPipeline.py script. 

To run here at the pex_harness level, we perform by hand a couple of tasks 
that ctrl_orca provides during "production" runs. 

We link the input directory:

% ln -s /lsst/DC3/stacks/default/Linux64/afwdata/svn11397 input

and make the output directory : 

% mkdir output 

The pipeline can be then started via : 

% launchPipeline.py master.paf test_15038

The pipeline will block and wait for an incoming data event.
Provide this event with the trigger script :

% python triggerISREventTransmitter.py 

This script will send events of topic "triggerISREvent" that contain a keyword
to identify the data set (uncalibratedImage) to be processed, for example,

"inputPathName" => "871034p_1_MI"

The Output Stage is configured to produce a single calibrated output file :

% ls -l output
........Fill in the sample ls........
